# Coupled Bistable Switches

This repository is a supplement to the couple bistable switches paper. The repository includes codes that were used to analyze the results of Boolean and RACIPE simulations.

The RACIPE package used can be found at https://github.com/simonhb1990/RACIPE-1.0.

The Boolean simulations were done using the packages https://github.com/ComplexityBiosystems/bmodel and https://github.com/csbBSSE/bmodel_julia.
